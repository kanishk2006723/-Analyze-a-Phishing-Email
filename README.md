# -Analyze-a-Phishing-Email
The PDF explains that since the original email headers were not accessible, a simulated header example was created based on the sender's email and domain visible in the screenshot. This simulated example was then submitted to the Google Message Header Analyzer.The document shows the results of this analysis.The process to get an original email header involves opening the email, finding the "more" menu, and selecting "Show original". The raw text can then be copied and pasted into a reliable header analyzer tool like Google's Message Header Analyzer or MXToolbox Email Header Analyzer.******Thank You********
